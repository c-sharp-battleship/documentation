# Meeting Prep
1. Discuss inefficiencies from last meeting among team members.
2. Assign roles for meetings.
3. Discuss technologies that we should use for code (Github, Google Drive, Dropbox, Onedrive, etc.).
4. Work on piecing together the code that we've been working on independently.
5. Create a more-complete UML diagram that the instructor can see.

# Meeting Notes

## Independent Work

We discussed the work that we have been working on independently and came up with a plan on how to implement it into a larger codebase.

### Gerson's Work
Gerson managed to create a GUI for the game that uses a grid with hundreds of tiny buttons.

### David's Work
David managed to create a GUI for the game using WPF's canvas feature. His code allows for drag-and-drop.

### Samuel's Work
Samuel managed to implement the core components of the UML diagram and created a window-loading GUI.

# Assignments
- Gerson will be combining the work of David and Samuel into a larger code base for submission.
- Sanaaia will be insuring that Gerson's code is StyleCop-compliant.
- Samuel will be working on implementing the UML diagram for Gerson's code.

We will convene to discuss our assignments on Tuesday, April 12th at 5:00 PM (Central Daylight Time). Those with explicit assignments are required to show up. For all other parties, attendance is optional.

As always, happy coding!

- Samuel Mace
