# Meeting Notes

## Logistics

### Git

Every team member needs to get on board with using git and github. Maybe this is using the integrated Visual Studio git tool. Maybe this means using the command line tool. All team members should get basic familiarity with git.

Github will be the online collaboration tool and the origin of our git code (where we publish it). All team members need to create a Github account and post their email address on Discord.

## Project

### Gerson's Ideas

- Create a GameWindow
- Create a Canvas class and place it on the window.
- Create a dimension (width and length) for each square (battleship coordinate) of the grid.
- Create an instance of a rectangle to represent a ship.

### Sam's Ideas

- We need to resize our grid to a 10x10 grid.
- We need to make our ships one-dimensional (only having one grid space as a length).
- To make sure that the ships don't go onto the attack board, you could listen for a drop event and do the math to adjust the ship's position.

# Homework

## Samuel
- Project documentation, website, and meeting minutes.
- Assist other team members with using git.

## David

## Lincoln
- Work on merging Gerson's non-git code with the refactoring branch.

## Sanaaia
- Work with David on coming up with ideas for the project.

## Gerson
- Work on a basic UML diagram that details the classes actually used currently (not all the nitty-gritty, but the basic stuff).
